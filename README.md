# MyToDoApp

This is some basic ToDo App I've created to develop my skills as a Java developer. 

The app was made using: Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies management), IntelliJ (IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server.
